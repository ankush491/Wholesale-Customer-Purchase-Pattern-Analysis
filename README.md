# Wholesale-Customer-Purchase-Pattern-Analysis



üìä Wholesale Customer Purchase Pattern Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing and modeling the purchasing behavior of wholesale customers using various supervised machine learning algorithms. The aim is to understand customer purchase patterns and predict potential future behaviors for strategic decision-making.
üîç Project Overview

The dataset contains purchasing details of wholesale customers across different product categories. Using this data, multiple machine learning models are built to classify and predict customer purchasing behavior. This project includes:

    Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA)

    Feature selection and scaling

    Training and evaluating multiple ML models

    Combining model predictions using stacking to improve overall accuracy

üß† Machine Learning Models Used

The following models are implemented and evaluated:

    K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

    Support Vector Machine (SVM)

    Decision Tree

    Random Forest

    XGBoost

To improve prediction accuracy and leverage the strengths of each model, a stacking ensemble model is implemented. The final performance is assessed by calculating the mean accuracy across all models.
‚öôÔ∏è Key Features
